The flex cable inserts into the connector situated between the Ethernet and HDMI ports, with the silver connectors 
facing the HDMI port. The flex cable connector should be opened by pulling the tabs on the top of the connector 
upwards then towards the Ethernet port. The flex cable should be inserted firmly into the connector, with care taken 
not to bend the flex at too acute an angle. The top part of the connector should then be pushed towards the HDMI 
connector and down, while the flex cable is held in place. (Please view the video above to watch the cable being 
inserted.)

The camera may come with a small piece of translucent blue plastic film covering the lens. This is only present to 
protect the lens while it is being mailed to you, and needs to be removed by gently peeling it off.
